about:
    description: 'Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter, built on top of Clang and
        LLVM compiler infrastructure. Cling realizes the read-eval-print loop (REPL)
        concept, in order to leverage rapid application development. Implemented as
        a small extension to LLVM and Clang, the interpreter reuses their strengths
        such as the praised concise and expressive compiler diagnostics.
